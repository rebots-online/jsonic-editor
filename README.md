edit json without your eyes bugging out

jsonic editor is a web app that presents .json files in a similar format to a concept map, so instead of nested brackets, the content is grouped into ‘thought bubble’ type shapes--say goodbye to mismatched brackets that you have no clue where to fix and just prevent the problem in the first place!

How to Use:

Using File > Open (CTRL-O), you can open an existing .json file for editing; alternatively, you can begin a new blank one by simply typing in the default blank bubble on the editor canvas.

When you want to begin a new brace bracket grouping, click the icon or hit \<TAB> to create a child. \<SHIFT>-\<TAB> returns you to editing the parent node, where \<TAB> again can either create a new child sibling to the first you created or return to the child, depending on settings in Edit > Preferences. 

Otherwise, using \<CTRL>-\<ARROW> keys navigates between child-siblings and parents. Alternatively, clicking into another bubble will change editing focus to it.

To Save the file, click File > Save (CTRL-S)
