# JSONic - JSON Concept Map Editor
## Project Overview and Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary

JSONic is a revolutionary desktop application that transforms the way developers, data analysts, and technical professionals work with JSON data. By presenting JSON structures as visual concept maps rather than nested brackets, JSONic eliminates one of the most common sources of frustration in JSON editing: mismatched brackets and difficult-to-parse nested structures.

Built with the Tauri framework for optimal performance and security, JSONic offers a native desktop experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. The application combines the precision of traditional text-based JSON editors with the intuitive visualization of concept mapping software.

### Problem Statement

Working with complex JSON structures presents several challenges:

1. **Bracket Matching**: It's easy to lose track of opening and closing brackets in deeply nested structures
2. **Visual Complexity**: Large JSON files become difficult to navigate and understand
3. **Error Prone**: Manual editing often leads to syntax errors and mismatched structures
4. **Cognitive Load**: Mental parsing of nested structures reduces productivity
5. **Limited Visualization**: Traditional editors don't provide visual representation of data relationships

### Solution Overview

JSONic addresses these challenges through:

1. **Visual Concept Mapping**: JSON structures are displayed as interconnected "thought bubbles"
2. **Dual Interface**: Switch between visual graph view and traditional text editor
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Familiar keyboard shortcuts (TAB, SHIFT-TAB, CTRL-ARROW) for navigation
4. **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop reorganization of JSON elements
5. **Comment Support**: Handle JSON comments which standard JSON doesn't support
6. **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on all major desktop operating systems

### Key Features

- **File Operations**: Open, save, and create JSON files with standard shortcuts (CTRL+O, CTRL+S)
- **Visual Editing**: Display JSON as interconnected nodes in a concept map
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigate and edit with familiar shortcuts
- **Node Manipulation**: Create, edit, delete, and reorganize JSON elements visually
- **Dual View**: Switch between graph visualization and text editor

#### Advanced Features
- **Comment Support**: Handle JSON comments using comment-json library
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive reorganization of JSON elements
- **Export Options**: Save visualizations as images
- **Preferences**: Customizable layouts and keyboard shortcuts
- **Error Handling**: Visual feedback for JSON syntax errors
